### Section 1: Loading Libraries

```{r Chunk 1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r LoadDataset, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

# Read in dataset 
LifeExp_data <- read.csv("data/life-expectancy-un-vs-gdp-per-capita-wb.csv")

# Data cleanup and wrangling to ensure data fits correct specifications for assessment 1
LifeExp_data <- LifeExp_data %>%
  # rename columns to simplify
  rename(
    Country = Entity,
    Life_expectancy = Life.expectancy...Sex..all...Age..0...Variant..estimates,
    GDP_per_capita = GDP.per.capita..PPP..constant.2017.international...,
    Population = Population..historical.
  ) %>% 
  # Select only relevant variables 
  select(Country, Year, Life_expectancy, GDP_per_capita, Population) %>% 
  # Remove missing values 
  filter(!is.na(GDP_per_capita) & !is.na(Life_expectancy) & !is.na(Population)) %>% 
  # Filter to keep four years (in 5-year intervals), reducing rows to < 1000
  filter(Year %in% c(2005, 2010, 2015, 2020))

### Section 2: Research Question 

This report will explore the relationship between GDP per capita, a key indicator of a country's wealth, and its correlation with life expectancy and population across multiple countries from 2005 to 2020. The analysis aims to determine whether GDP directly influences both life expectancy and population size during this period.


### Section 3: Data Set Introduction

The data used in this report (available [here](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy)) is sourced from the _Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita, 2022_ chart found in the _Population and Demographic Change_ topic on [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). It is intended to investigate the relationship between life expectancy and various economic and demographic variables across multiple countries over several decades. A link to the locatino of the data used in this report is provided. 

The dataset includes variables such as **Country**, **Year**, **GDP per Capita**, **Life Expectancy**, and **Population**, with thousands of observations across many countries and years. These variables provide insights into the economic and demographic factors that influence life expectancy globally.

```{r}

# Retrieve the variable names from LifeExp_data
variable_names <- colnames(LifeExp_data)

variable_names_table <- data.frame(variable_names)


kable(variable_names_table, caption = "Table of column names")
```


### Section 4: Data Set Description 


The data set has undergone data wrangling and cleanup to ensure that it fits within the desired assessment specifications. The main transformations include selecting only the 5 columns/variables listed above, removing missing values and filtering the Years variables for 5 year intervals starting at 2005. Following these transformations, the dataset is ready for analysis and contains `r nrow(LifeExp_data)` observatinos and `r ncol(LifeExp_data)` variables. 

```{r figure 1, fig.align= "center", fig.cap="Screenshot of Code", out.height= "70%", out.width= "70%"}

```

```{r variable type, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
str(LifeExp_data[1:2, ])
```
